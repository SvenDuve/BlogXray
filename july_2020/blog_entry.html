                        AI will be the new standard in X-Ray detection
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        We took a batch of approximately 5000 images of x-ray screens of children in China. 
                        The images were provided by Kaggle. The first issue we detected was class-imbalance. 
                        There were many more bacterial infections than viral ones. What happens is that if a certain 
                        class is much bigger than the other, the algorithm finds optimal solutions for predicting a certain 
                        class.
                    </p>
                    <div class="box">
                        <img id="midImg" src="./../images/IM-0135-0001.jpeg" alt="">
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Now this can be overcome by making sure classes are balanced. So if we classify three
                        types of images, we require <u>roughly</u> 33 per cent of each class. Once this is achieved,
                        the algorithm is not likely to <em>fall over</em> to a certain class.
                    </p>
                    <div class="box">
                        <img id="midImg" src="./../images/person97_virus_181.jpeg" alt="">
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Class balance can be generated if we use the existing image base and <em>fake</em> new ones
                        from old picture, by slightly tilting of applying a a very subtle coloring to them. <br> In the 
                        end we used a Neural Network with a hidden ReLU layer. The success rate was north of 90 per cent. This 
                        sounds indeed very positive, but there is a lot of work left to do. Have a look at these older posts for 
                        deeper information on Neural Networds,
